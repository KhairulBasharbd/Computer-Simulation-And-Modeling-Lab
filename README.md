# Computer Simulation and Mdeling lab problem list...


## Question 1: Simulation of a pure pursuit problem.

## Question 2: Simulation of critical path method.

## Question 3: Simulation of linear congruential generator method.

## Question 4: Simulation of a Chemical Reactor.

## Question 5: Simulation of a cubic Bezier curve.

## Question 6: Forecasting by ARIMA model.
#### a) Identify ARIMA Order (p, d, q)

Plot the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF).

#### b) Model Estimation

Fit the ARIMA model to the training data using the identified order (p, d, q).

#### c) Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set. Use Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

#### d) Forecasting

Generate forecasts for future time points using the trained ARIMA model. Visualize the forecasts along with confidence intervals.
